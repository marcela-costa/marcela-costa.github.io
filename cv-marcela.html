					<h2>UX/UI Researcher at Tecgraf/PUC-Rio, Brazil</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">February 2011 - February 2013</p>
					<p>Thesis title: "Evaluation of 2D-3D visualization and attention management techniques for the operation of industrial plants".</p>
					<p>The main objective of my research was to provide an environment to support a scenario of industrial plants monitoring in real time, exploring techniques of information visualization and scientific data in an integrated environment that mixed 2D and 3D visualizations, determining how important information would be displayed to call the user’s attention through warnings about risky situations. Thus, my study’s main research question was to investigate ways of combining these techniques and propose ways to handle the occlusion, the difficulties of navigation in the 3D environment and different ways to draw the user’s attention, considering both the events that are in his field of vision as those who are outside of his field of view (due to the possibility of free navigation).</p>

					<p>For my conclusion project (Final Project) I developed "A Tool for Management of SCRUM Projects".</p>
					This project was aimed at developing Agile Project Management Development software based on Scrum. This software was designed to meet the needs of the “Engeneering Automation Cel” (CAE) group of TecGraf laboratory directly focused on the Scrum methodology, thepurpose was to be easy to use and have a simple interface, in order to offer a more satisfaction and return during the process of developing software in this environment.</p>
